My Browser was outdated and the HTML5 audio did not support that version. I updated the browser and it works perfectly fine. But thank you for this solution as well. I will look into this as well and try to explore it more. Might come handy in future.

It's an old blog post and even has a warning at the top that says it might be outdated, so don't take his advice on using the IAM service via the AWS CLI. That's just the old method that you had to use before the ACM service became available. 2. He is telling you ""paste the output from the following commands"" into some files, and that is also exactly what you need to paste into the AWS ACM web console. 3. If you look at the certificate chain command, he is actually chaining two commands together to create the certificate chain from those two files."	2016-11-10T14:59:34.957	13070	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40530478	TRUE		0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	amazon-elb	outdated			1	1	0	0			0	222313428	15710553	0	"Are you using the 2.0 line? send_email() is from the old 1.0 library, which has been deprecated.
